## Day #1 (14-09-2023)
I started by putting on the founder hat, the role of the founder is to come up with the idea, secure funds and get the company started.
The first thing I needed was a business plan, so I saw [this very informative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btsKJdLmXgc) on YouTube; being a pretend business this structure does not apply to us and we don't have the need for it.
So I went over to ChatGPT to create one that would work.
Nobody would like to invest in this business looking at the business plan but it's good enough for now.
## Day #2 (15-09-2023)
Let's start with design thinking. To understand what the user wants we will create a user survey.
