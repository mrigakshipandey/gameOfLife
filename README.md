## Day #1 (14-09-2023)
I started by putting on the founder hat. The role of the founder is to come up with the idea, secure funds and get the company started.
The first thing I need, is a business plan, so I saw [this very informative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btsKJdLmXgc) on YouTube. Being a pretend Business, this structure does not apply to us and we don't need it.
So, I went over to ChatGPT to create one that would work.
Nobody would like to invest looking at the business plan, but it's good enough for now.

To properly get into character, I also went ahead and read some entrepreneurship books:
- The Lean Startup by Eric Ries
- A Technique For Producing Ideas by James Webb Young
## Day #2 (15-09-2023)
The first thing we would need is a problem to solve and a popular method for defining problem statements is [Design Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nTh3AP6knM&list=PLEiEAq2VkUUIz01StTtLRDtXwNVwjj-Nc).

We must conduct an [Empathy Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91ujUV4juf0) to find what our users want. Conducting a proper Interview would conflict with the core principle of our organization. Which is - "Make it cheap, Make it fast, Make it easy".
May I suggest a Google form with three open-ended questions?
This is something that a Product Owner would do in a [Scrum Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ_sl6J8PRg). So, let's add this hat to our collection.
Our organization chart looks as follows:
